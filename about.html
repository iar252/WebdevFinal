		</div>

		<p class="textsize">As one client put it: "From the start, Melanie was an incredibly calming, soothing and loving presence. she listened intently to what we wanted, needed and could afford. We chose the second apartment she showed us. She negotiated an amazing deal in a wonderful building and we are not only happy, but very greatful. She held our hands from the beginning to the end. She even helped us upack! Melanie Siben is the complete package and will always go the extra mile. BEST. REALTOR. EVER!" -Susi Romney (Fifth Avenue at 62nd) </p>

		<p class="textsize">At 18, Melanie was one of New York's youngest real estate agents. She is originally from Bay Shore, New York, but has lived and worked in Japan, Europe and on Guam as a model, student and journalist.</p>

		<h3>Real Estate</h3>
		</div>
		<p class="textsize indenting">"A month after my 18th birthday, I got my real estate license. Soon after, I began driving clients around Long Island areas that I never knew existed. I still remember my first deal. It was a mile from the ocean. I found a newly-married couple their first home... a charming $800 rental above the local florist (Pathey Gardens in West Islip). Both the couple and the property owners were so happy. That experience had a profound effect on me."
		"Residential real estate involves people and their emotions. We real estate agents need to be sensitive, listen, and take a holistic approach. My clients know I genuinely care about their needs and will ultimately negotiate for them the best possible deal.
		</p>
		<p class="textsize">Commercial real estate is more about numbers, but no one wants to be treated like a robot. Everyone craves trust and compassion. This is why I am passionate about BOTH areas of real estate and committed to always putting my clients' needs ahead of my own."

			For 16 years following her work as a journalist, Melanie became a pioneer in the battle against human trafficking.  In 2000, she founded Media 4 Humanity, a 501-c-3 dedicated to eradicating child trafficking and abuse in the United States. </p>
 			
			<p class="textsize">Melanie, along with thousands of media professionals and nearly 400 students over the years, worked tirelessly on their "Get REAL" campaign. Rescue, Empowerment, Awareness and Legislation were their programs. </p>
 
			<p class="textsize">The internship program Melanie started grew to one of the largest unpaid, non-profit programs in the country and attracted students from every Ivy League university and other fine academic institutions. </p>
			 
			<p class="textsize">Now that Melanie has returned to real estate, her internship program focuses on CSR... corporate social responsibility as well as the Awareness and Legislation elements of M4H's Get Real Campaign.  <br>
			Together, their long-range goal is to create non federally-assisted yet self-sustaining housing for survivors of child trafficking and eventually for all homeless individuals. "Teach a man to fish..." is their approach to starting and sustaining this ideal.</p>
